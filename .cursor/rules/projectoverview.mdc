description: Project Description:

This project is a Solana memecoin analytics tool that allows users to analyze the distribution of any SPL token by holders. By pasting a token mint address (e.g., 3L8MNSHc3V7ssEdQiHRbGrJfMPaSJMKykhBHKgikpump), the application fetches the tokenâ€™s total supply and retrieves the largest token accounts on-chain. It then maps each token account back to its wallet owner, aggregates balances across multiple accounts per owner, and calculates the percentage of the total supply each holder controls.

The output is a ranked list of holders (whales, liquidity pools, exchanges, and individual wallets) sorted by percentage ownership, providing clear insights into token concentration and decentralization.

This tool will be built as a Chrome extension, allowing users to analyze token distributions directly while browsing DEXs, token explorers, or social media platforms without leaving their current tab.
